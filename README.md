# The jprogress progression engine
The Java progression engine, called jprogress, implements support for the progression of MTL formulas with partial-state information.
It does so by keeping track of all the formulas progression could have reached, given the observed partial-state stream.
For more details, we refer to the extended abstract on jprogress:
- de Leng, D., and Heintz., F. 2018. Partial-State Progression for Stream Reasoning with Metric Temporal Logic. In Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.


## Installation
The software has been prepared as a Maven project in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
We recommend cloning the repository and opening the provided project files in IntelliJ IDEA.


## Getting Started
The jprogress implementation in its current form does not yet provide an interactive mode using for example command-line interface.
It is best regarded as a library.


## License
The software is released under the MIT license.
